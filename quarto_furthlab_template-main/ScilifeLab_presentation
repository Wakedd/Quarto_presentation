## `Introduction of me: :)` <br><br>

- &nbsp;&nbsp;  Biomedicine  <br><br>
- &nbsp;&nbsp;  22 years , born in Syria <br><br>
- &nbsp;&nbsp; Football: ⚽ Tennis: 🎾  Piano: 🎹  

## `How i ended up here on my bachelor's ? `<br><br> 


- &nbsp;&nbsp;Medical genetic course 🧬 <br><br> 
   - took contact with Daniel`<br><br> 

- <span style="color: blue;">Huge interest and curiosity for cell biology 🦠 and physiology 🧠 🫀 🫁</span>


## `The idea behinde the project:`
- Our current understanding of memory

## `Synapse building and plasticity regarding memory formation: `
    
  - LTP (long term potentiation: ), strong exciting through: 

    . AMPA receptor activation INDEPENDENT of protein synthesis --> fast responce 

    . Gene transkription --> slow responce 

  - The transformation from short-term memory to long-term memory 


## `Although ...`

         Francis Crick is at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 N. Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 91037, USA 

## `Peopls thoughts on a time-line: ` <br> 

1906 - Jennings HS. "he essential point seems to be that after experience the organism reacts in a more effective way than before. The change is regulatory, not merely haphazard
" <br><br>
1911 - Day LM, Bentley M."With repeated trials, the Paramecia increased the speed with which they achieved reversal" <br> <br>

1979 - Hennessey TM, Rucker WB, McDiarmid CG. "Tesed aversive uncondi- tioned stimuli such as shock or heat"<br><br> 
2006 - Rmus HL, Montgomery AR, Gurney RL "Showed that Paramecia learned to associate the location of cathodal stimulation (which exerted an attractive effect) with a light-conditioned stimulus" 

## `what i did this summer : `

- Since almost every tool is "handmade", it took a while getting things up and running. 

    . Raspberry Pi- openCV- CONDA- etc... <brb>
- Taking care of my own cell culture  <brb>

    . Paramecium eat bacteria  
    . Bacterium eat wheat-grass
